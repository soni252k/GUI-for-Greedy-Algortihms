# GUI_for_Greedy_Algortihms_using_Python_and_tkinter

This is a group project by: me (https://github.com/soni252k), Kaushiki Taru (https://github.com/Kaushiki333) and Lakshay Singhal (https://github.com/Lakshay-Singhal) which we did as a part of our course project in second year of out B.Tech.

Greedy algorithms are implemented with graphical user interface in python using Tkinter Library This is a GUI based menu driven program, You can use it by opening the main file and then navigate using the graphical user interface.

###Libraries included:

1. tkinter
2. pyinstaller
3. time
4. subprocess
5. messagebox
6. font

###Instructions to use:

1. The 'GreedyAlgorithms' is the main gui program.
2. Total of 5 algorithms available (all Greedy):
	Kruskal's Algo
	Fractional Knapsack
	Huffman Coding
	Activity Selection Problem
	Dijkstra's Algorithm 
3. All the algos have separate input method (explained below).
4. Each algo has its time complexity beside the name, in the main window.
5. Credit button displays the info about project creators.


###Input formats:

1. Minimum Spanning tree - Kruskal's :
	>>Click on the workspace to create nodes.
	>>Draw line using the button provided below.
	>>Once the graph is completed, click on 'Find MST' button.
	>>The final path is coloured red.
	
2. Fractional Knapsack Problem : 
	>>Enter the capacity of the bag.
	>>Create as many items you want to.
	>>Enter the respective weights and values of each item.
	>>Save the input when you are done. 
	>>Click 'Get Maximum Value' button and get the final value.

3. Huffman Coding :
	>>Enter the string to be coded.
	>>Press 'Find result' button.
	>>The huffman encoding of the string is shown. 

4. Activity Selection Problem :
	>>Create activities using 'Create Activity' button.
	>>Enter the start and end time of each task.
	>>Once done, finalise the activities.
	>>Click on the 'Select Activities' button to view the solution.

5. Dijkstra,s Algorithm :
	>>Enter the total number of nodes.
	>>Enter the cost of path between each nodes.
	>>Select the target node.
	>>Result is displayed.
